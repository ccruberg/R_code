Exploring the CTA Ridership data: data is from the City of Chicago Data Portal and can be found at <https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f?>.

The purpose of this analysis is to understand which "L" stops are the busiest and understand what makes a train stop busy. It wil focus mostly on the Red Line route and specifically on the Fullerton station. Eventually I would like to understand the morning commute and be able to determine what time should I leave for work in the morning?

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
install.packages('ggplot2', dependencies = T, repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/") 
library('ggplot2')

install.packages('ggplot2', dependencies = T, repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/") 
library('ggplot2')


getwd()
setwd('C:/Users/charlier/Documents/Enrichment/Data')

cta <- read.csv('cta_rides.csv') 
fullerton <- cta[cta$stationname == 'Fullerton',]
fullerton$time <- as.Date(fullerton$date, "%m/%d/%Y")

```

Which stop is the busiest?

```{r}

```


Has Fullerton ridership increased over time? Is there a pre-existing trend in ridership? Here is a scatter plot looking only at the Fullerton stop over the entire time period found in the data. 

**Fullerton Ridership over Time (A = Saturday, U = Sunday/Holiday, W = Weekday)**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = time, y = rides, color  = daytype), data = fullerton) +
  scale_x_date() +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
  ggtitle('Fullerton Ridership over Time by Daytype')
```
